### __Discord Permissions__  
Discord recently enabled a new feature that requires you to enable the Privileged Gateway Intents options in the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to access Discord member lists.  

The bot requires the following Discord permissions:  

- Read Messages  
- Send Messages  
- Manage Messages (Prune quest channels)  
- Manage Roles (If cities are enabled)  
- Manage Emojis  
- Embed Links  
- Attach Files (`export` command)  
- Use External Emojis  


### __Notes__
- If `dotnet` is not in your path, you'll need to use `~/.dotnet/dotnet` instead of just `dotnet` for commands.  
- If you ran the original install command as `root`, `dotnet` will be located at `/root/.dotnet/dotnet` and you'll need to either use that for build commands or replace the `~/.dotnet/dotnet` path with it when adding to your path.
- Upon starting, database tables will be automatically created if `subscriptions.enabled` is set to `true`. Emoji icons are also created in the specified `EmojiGuildId` upon connecting to Discord.
